2024-09-04 22:14:08 [INFO] On a chess board, two rooks are placed peacefully if they are not on the same row or column. For an n x n chess board, find the number of ways that n rooks can be placed peacefully (i.e., any two are placed peacefully) and the placing is also invariant to a 180-degree rotation.

2024-09-04 22:20:13 [INFO] final answer: The final answer to the problem is:

- If \( n \) is even:
  \[
  \text{Number of configurations} = \frac{n!}{(n/2)!}
  \]
- If \( n \) is odd:
  \[
  \text{Number of configurations} = \frac{(n-1)!}{((n-1)/2)!}
  \]
